# Algorithms
This a collection of a variety of algorithms that I've found useful. Most have a python implementation for practical use.

# Contents
The following algorithms are included herein:
1. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm
2. Solver for Knapsack Problem
3. Dynamic Programming Methods (for Fibonacci Sequence)

...and many more to come.
